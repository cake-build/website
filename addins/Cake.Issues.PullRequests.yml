Description: "The pull requests issues addin for Cake allows you to write issue from any code analyzer or linter as comments to pull requests.

This addin provides the aliases for writing issues to pull requests.
It requires the core Cake.Issues addin, addins for reading issues and an addin for the specific pull request system.

See the Project Site for an overview of the whole ecosystem of addins for working with issues in Cake scripts."
