Description: |
The Azure DevOps support for the Cake.Issues addin for Cake allows you to
write found issues as comments to Azure DevOps pull requests.

This addin provides the aliases for writing to Azure DevOps pull requests.
It also requires the core Cake.Issues and Cake.Issues.PullRequests addins and one or more issue providers.

See the Project Site for an overview of the whole ecosystem of addins for working with issues in Cake scripts.
