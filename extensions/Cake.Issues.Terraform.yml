  The Terraform support for the Cake.Issues addin for Cake allows you to read issues logged by terraform validate.


  This addin provides the aliases for reading terraform validate output and providing them to the Cake.Issues addin.

  It also requires the core Cake.Issues addin.


  There are also additional addins for generating reports or posting issues to pull requests.


  See the Project Site for an overview of the whole ecosystem of addins for working with issues in Cake scripts.
