        <h1>What is Cake?</h1>
        <p>Cake (C# Make) is a cross-platform build automation system with a C# DSL for tasks such as compiling code, copying files and folders, running unit tests, compressing files and building NuGet packages.</p>

            <h3 class="align-top">Familiar</h3>
            <p>
                Cake is built on top of the Roslyn compiler which enables you to write your build scripts in C#.
            </p>

            <h3>Cross platform</h3>
            <p>
                Cake is available on Windows, Linux and macOS.
            </p>

            <h3>Cross runtime</h3>
            <p>
                Cake runs on .NET Core, .NET Framework and Mono.
            </p>

            <h3>Flexible</h3>
            <p>
                Cake can be used with scripts or as simple console applications with full IDE integration.
                See <a href="docs/running-builds/runners">Runners</a> for a list of available runners.
            </p>

            <h3>Reliable</h3>
            <p>
                Regardless if you're building on your own machine, or building on a CI system such as AppVeyor, Azure DevOps,
                TeamCity or Jenkins, Cake is built to behave in the same way.
            </p>

            <h3>Batteries included</h3>
            <p>
                Cake supports the most common tools used during builds such as MSBuild, .NET Core CLI, MSTest, xUnit, NUnit,
                NuGet, ILMerge, WiX and SignTool out of the box and many more through an ever growing list of <a href="/addins">addins</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Open source</h3>
            <p>
                We believe in open source and so should you. The source code for Cake is
                <a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake">hosted on GitHub</a> and
                includes everything needed to build it yourself.
