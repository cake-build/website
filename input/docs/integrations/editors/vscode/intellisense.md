# Troubleshooting

## I've followed the steps, but I don't get any IntelliSense.

The [C# extension for Visual Studio Code] will automatically locate any `*.sln` file and use that as the target directory when starting OmniSharp.
If your `*.cake` files are located in a different location, you might need to select `Cake` project in the [project selector](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp#_roslyn-and-omnisharp).

## I've selected the `Cake` project, but still don't get IntelliSense.

Look in the `OmniSharp Log` for errors or warnings.

Here are some common errors and fixes:

```
[warn]: OmniSharp.Cake.CakeProjectSystem
    Cake script service not connected. Aborting.
```

This warning is an indication that [Cake.Bakery] isn't installed.
See above how to install [Cake.Bakery].

```
[fail]: OmniSharp.Cake.CakeProjectSystem
    c:\Users\mb\src\gh\bakery\setup.cake will be ignored due to an following error
    System.TypeLoadException: A null or zero length string does not represent a valid Type.
```

This error usually means that Cake isn't available.
If using Cake Runner for .NET Framework make sure Cake is installed in your `tools` folder.
The easiest way to do this is to run your bootstrapping file (e.g. `.\build.ps1`).

## I don't see any error message and still don't get IntelliSense.

Look in the `OmniSharp Log` do you see anything even related to Cake if everything is setup correctly, you should at least see something similar to this:

```
[info]: OmniSharp.Cake.CakeProjectSystem
    Detecting Cake files in 'c:\Users\mb\src\gh\bakery'.
[info]: OmniSharp.Cake.CakeProjectSystem
    Found 29 Cake files.
```

If you don't, you probably have issues with getting the [C# extension for Visual Studio Code] installed.
Please uninstall the extension and then try installing it again.
Look for `OmniSharp.Cake.dll` in `%userprofile%\.vscode\extensions\ms-vscode.csharp-1.13.0\.omnisharp\` if you're on Windows and
`~/.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode.csharp-1.13.0/.omnisharp/` if you are running Linux or Mac OS
(replace `1.13.0` with the version of the C# extension for Visual Studio Code which you have installed).

## How can I use a pre-release version of OmniSharp

To use a pre-release version of OmniSharp follow these steps:

* Open command palette (<code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code>)
* Select <code>Open User Settings</code> command

  ![Open user settings](/assets/img/intellisense-vscode/open-user-settings.png)
* Search for `omnisharp.path` and click `Edit in settings.json`

  ![omnisharp.path settings](/assets/img/intellisense-vscode/omnisharp-path.png)
* Set `"omnisharp.path": "latest"` and save settings
* Answer question if you want to restart OmniSharp server with yes
* Wait until new version of OmniSharp is downloaded, installed and started

## I tried everything above, I still don't get IntelliSense.
