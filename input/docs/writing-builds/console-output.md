Description: How to output content to console
---

# Logging

Cake provides [logging aliases] for writing log messages to the console.

[Logging aliases]: /dsl/logging/

# Advanced output

Cake ships with [Spectre.Console], which provides advanced functionality to output content to the console,
like [progress bars], [spinners], [tables], [trees], [bar charts] or [FIGlet text].

Use the `AnsiConsole` class to render advanced widgets to the console.

See [Spectre.Console] documentation for details.
