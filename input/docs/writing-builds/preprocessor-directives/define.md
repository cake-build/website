Title: Define directive
Description: Directive for conditional code execution
---

The define directive - `#define` creates a symbol, it can be later use to decide, what Cake will execute. You use it like `#define` in C#.
To check if symbol is defined, you have to use directives `#if` ... `#else` ... `#endif`

# Usage

```csharp
#define FOO

#if (FOO)
    // code in this branch will execute
#else
    // code in this branch will be skipped
#endif
```

# Predefined symbols

Some symbols can be predefined by Cake depending on the environment.
