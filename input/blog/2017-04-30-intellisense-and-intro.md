Hi! My name is Martin Björkström and I'm a .NET Developer and father of two from Finland. I started using Cake in early 2016 and have been doing [contributions](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/commits?author=mholo65) ever since. To this day, the most notable is probably [debugging support](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/pull/858). Since April, I'm also a member of the Cake Team.

So why am I a member of the Cake Team? Well, it all started with a new year's resolution gone wrong. I somehow _promised_ that 2017 will be the year when we will get intellisense for `*.cake` files.

Said and done, I started looking into [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) and after a while I got something working. The Cake Team was _impressed?!_ and wanted me to continue my work on a more _official_ level. Hence, they asked me to join the team.

Since that, we´ve continued working on the `Cake` plugin for `OmniSharp`. We've also opened up a dialogue with the OmniSharp team in order to tackle issues along the way. My last tweet shows where we are today.

We got it _mostly_ working and I'm pretty confident when saying _Intellisense will happen during 2017_. We still have lots of work to do, but both we and the OmniSharp team are working hard to make this happen. At this point I would like to thank the Cake Team for letting me in on this journey. OmniSharp team (especially [David Driscoll](https://github.com/david-driscoll) and [Dustin Campbell](https://github.com/DustinCampbell)) for all the hard work and support. Last but not least I'd like to thank [Richard Simpson](https://github.com/RichiCoder1) for his work on [paving the way](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/208) for OmniSharp plugins.
