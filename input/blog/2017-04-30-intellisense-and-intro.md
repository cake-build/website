Hi! My name is Martin Björkström and I'm a .NET Developer and father of two from Finland.  I started using Cake in early 2016 and have been making [contributions](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/commits?author=mholo65) ever since. So far, the most notable is probably [debugging support](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/pull/858).  As of April, I'm also a member of the Cake Team!

So, why am I a member of the Cake Team?  Well, it all started with a new year's resolution gone wrong.  I somehow _promised_ that 2017 will be the year when we will get intellisense for `*.cake` files.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/gep13">@gep13</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cakebuildnet">@cakebuildnet</a> I hope that 2017 is the year when we will get intellisense through <a href="https://twitter.com/omnisharp">@omnisharp</a> ;)</p>&mdash; Martin Björkström (@mholo65) <a href="https://twitter.com/mholo65/status/815617341568512000">January 1, 2017</a></blockquote>

With that said, I started looking into [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) and after a while I got something working.  The Cake Team was _impressed?!_ and wanted me to continue my work on a more _official_ level.  As a result, they asked me to join the team.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/gep13">@gep13</a> Do you now know what you are looking at? ;) <a href="https://t.co/XTGtTRx85M">pic.twitter.com/XTGtTRx85M</a></p>&mdash; Martin Björkström (@mholo65) <a href="https://twitter.com/mholo65/status/847916254740570119">March 31, 2017</a></blockquote>

Since then, we´ve continued working on the `Cake` plugin for `OmniSharp`.  We've also opened up a dialogue with the OmniSharp team in order to tackle issues along the way.  My last tweet shows where we are today:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Intellisense, anyone? Here&#39;s a teaser for you!<br><br>//cc <a href="https://twitter.com/cakebuildnet">@cakebuildnet</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/omnisharp">@omnisharp</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/code">@code</a> <a href="https://t.co/n5xAeJgmLy">pic.twitter.com/n5xAeJgmLy</a></p>&mdash; Martin Björkström (@mholo65) <a href="https://twitter.com/mholo65/status/857731193554554881">April 27, 2017</a></blockquote>

We have it _mostly_ working and I'm pretty confident when saying _Intellisense will happen during 2017_.  We still have lots of work to do, but both we, and the OmniSharp team, are working hard to make this happen.  At this point I would like to thank the Cake Team for letting me in on this journey.  The OmniSharp team (especially [David Driscoll](https://github.com/david-driscoll) and [Dustin Campbell](https://github.com/DustinCampbell)) for all the hard work and support.  And lastly, but by no means least, I'd like to thank [Richard Simpson](https://github.com/RichiCoder1) for his work on [paving the way](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/208) for OmniSharp plugins.
