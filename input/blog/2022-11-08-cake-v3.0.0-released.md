Version **3.0.0** of Cake has been released. Take it for a spin and give us feedback on our [discussion board](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions/4064).

This release includes several new features, improvements and bug fixes to both [Cake Scripting](/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-tool) and [Cake Frosting](/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting) since the [Cake v2.3.0 release](/blog/2022/10/cake-v2.3.0-released)! 🚀 🍰

### Highlights of this release

- .NET 7 Support & C#11 Support
- TaskOf&lt;T&gt;
- Multiple target support
- Improved build providers
- Addin recommended Cake version set to 3.0.0

### Breaking changes

Being a major release we've taken the opportunity to remove obsolete aliases and members, i.e. DotNetCore* aliases were obsoleted and replaced by DotNet* aliases in Cake 2.0 and are now removed with 3.0.0.

Cake itself will no longer run on .NET Core 3.1 or .NET 5, but Cake will continue to support the building of .NET Framework projects, as well as projects targeting .NET 5.0 or older. 

The supported platform matrix for Cake 3.0.0 will look like this:

| Runner                           | .NET 7                                                | .NET 6                                                |

### .NET 7 Support & C# 11 Support

Cake now fully supports running on .NET 7, and with this C# 11, which means you can take advantage of the latest framework, runtime, and language improvements.

### TaskOf&lt;T&gt;

For scripting, a new `TaskOf<T>` method has been introduced to simplify when working with shared typed data contexts, where one only needs to specify the type parameter once and only get task methods that are relevant, example:

```csharp
public record BuildData(bool Initialized);

Setup(ctx => new BuildData(true));

TaskOf<BuildData>("TaskOfT")
    .Description("Very typed task")
    .WithCriteria((context, data) => data.Initialized)
    .Does((context, data) => context.Information("Initialized: {0}.", data.Initialized))
    .Does(async (context, data) => await /* async work*/)
    .DoesForEach(
        (data, context) => new [] { data.Initialized },
        (data, item, context) => context.Information("Item: {0}, Initialized: {1}.", item, data.Initialized)
    )
    .DoesForEach(
        new [] { true, false },
        (data, item, context) => context.Information("Item: {0}, Initialized: {1}.", item, data.Initialized)
    );

RunTarget("TaskOfT");
```

### Multiple target support

Also for scripting, a new `RunTargets(IEnumerable<string> targets)` method is now available. It'll let you specify multiple targets as the entry point in Cake's dependency graph to execute, where dependencies and dependency order is still respected. For example calling script below with `dotnet cake --target="A" --target="B"`

```csharp
Task("A")
    .Does(() => { /* do stuff */ });

Task("B")
    .IsDependentOn("C")
    .Does(() => { /* do stuff */ });

Task("C")
    .Does(() => { /* do stuff */ });

Task("Default");

RunTargets(Arguments<string>("target", new []{ "Default" }));
```

will generate the following execution

```bash
========================================
A
========================================

========================================
C
========================================

========================================
B
========================================

Task                          Duration
--------------------------------------------------
A                             00:00:00.0028166
C                             00:00:00.0006761
B                             00:00:00.0006161
--------------------------------------------------
Total:                        00:00:00.0041088
```

### Improved build providers

Cake 3.0.0 comes with a few improvements to build providers i.e.

- GitHub Actions
    - `SetStepSummary` Command
    - `SetOutputParameter` Command
    - Workflow commands
- TeamCity
    - Build status message
    - Statistics
- GitLab
    - `SetEnvironmentVariable` Command
    - CI runner tags improvements

### Addin recommended Cake version set to 3.0.0

We've now set the recommended version of [Cake.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core) for addins to target to 3.0.0.

This won't break the build, but you might see warnings like below when addins or modules are loaded.

```bash
The assembly 'Cake.Twitter, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' 
is referencing an older version of Cake.Core (2.0.0). 
For best compatibility it should target Cake.Core version 3.0.0.
```
