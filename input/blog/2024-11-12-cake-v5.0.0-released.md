Version **5.0.0** of Cake has been released. Take it for a spin and give us feedback on our [discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/cake-build/discussions/4397).

This release includes new features, improvements and bug fixes to both [Cake Scripting](/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-tool) and [Cake Frosting](/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting) since the [Cake v4.2.0 release](/blog/xxxx/xx/cake-v4.2.0-released)! 🚀 🍰

### Highlights of this release

- .NET 9 support & C# 13 support
- FreeBSD support
- Addin recommended Cake version set to 5.0.0
- 100 million downloads of Cake.Tool


### .NET 9 support & C# 13 support

Cake now fully supports running on .NET 9, and with this C# 13, which means you can take advantage of the latest framework, runtime, and language improvements.

Cake itself will no longer run on .NET 6 or .NET 7, but Cake will continue to support the building of .NET Framework projects, as well as projects targeting .NET 7.0 or older. 

The supported platform matrix for Cake 5.0.0 will look like this:

| Runner                           | .NET 9                                                | .NET 8                                                |

### FreeBSD support

The FreeBSD operating system should now be recognized as `Environment.Platform.Family` `PlatformFamily.FreeBSD`, and new `bool IsRunningOnFreeBSD` alias and `bool IsUnix` alias will now be true for FreeBSD.

### Addin recommended Cake version set to 5.0.0

We've now set the recommended version of [Cake.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core) for addins to target to 5.0.0.

This won't break the build, but you might see warnings like the one below when addins or modules are loaded.

```bash
The assembly 'Cake.Addin, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'
is referencing an older version of Cake.Core (4.0.0).
For best compatibility it should target Cake.Core version 5.0.0.
```

The recommended target framework monikers for addins are now:

- `net9.0`
- `net8.0`

### 100 million downloads of Cake.Tool
