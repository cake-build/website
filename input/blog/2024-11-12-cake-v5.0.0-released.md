### Highlights of this release

- FreeBSD support
- Addin recommended Cake version set to 5.0.0
- 100 million downloads of Cake.Tool


### .NET 9 support & C# 13 support

Cake now fully supports running on .NET 9, and with this C# 13, which means you can take advantage of the latest framework, runtime, and language improvements.

The supported platform matrix for Cake 5.0.0 will look like this:

| Runner                           | .NET 9                                                | .NET 8                                                |

| [Cake Frosting]                  | <i class="fa-solid fa-check" style="color:green"></i> | <i class="fa-solid fa-check" style="color:green"></i> |

### FreeBSD support

The FreeBSD operating system should now be recognized as `Environment.Platform.Family` `PlatformFamily.FreeBSD`, and new `bool IsRunningOnFreeBSD` alias and `bool IsUnix` alias will now be true for FreeBSD.

### Addin recommended Cake version set to 5.0.0

We've now set the recommended version of [Cake.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core) for addins to target to 5.0.0.

This won't break the build, but you might see warnings like the one below when addins or modules are loaded.

```bash
The assembly 'Cake.Addin, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'
is referencing an older version of Cake.Core (4.0.0).
For best compatibility it should target Cake.Core version 5.0.0.
```

The recommended target framework monikers for addins are now

- `net9.0`
- `net8.0`

### 100 million downloads of Cake.Tool
