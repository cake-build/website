releaseName: 1.3.0

Version **1.3.0** of Cake has been released. Take it for a spin and give us feedback on our [discussion board](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions/3558).

This release includes new features, improvements and bug fixes to both [Cake Scripting](/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-tool) and [Cake Frosting](/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting), and is likely going to be our last release in the 1.x milestone as we're now preparing for our next major release of Cake, version 2.0! 🚀 🍰

### Highlights of this release

- Support for .NET 6 (tested with the latest as of date: `6.0.100-rc.1.21463.6`)
  - This means you can now leverage all the [new features of C# 10.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10) when you run Cake using the .NET 6 SDK, as well as build Cake addins and modules targeting the `net6.0` TFM
- Support for Visual Studio 2022, MSBuild version 17, and custom MSBuild versions
- Ability to "break the build" whilst setting the exit code of the build process
  - e.g. `throw new CakeException(exitCode: 42);` will set `$LASTEXITCODE`, `%ERRORLEVEL%`, etc. to `42`
- New `EnsureDirectoryDoesNotExist` method which, as the name implies, deletes all contents of a directory if it exists
  - This is slightly different than `DeleteDirectory`, which also deletes all contents of a directory, but expects it to exists (and fails if it doesn't)
- New properties added to `DotNetCoreMSBuildSettings`, including `InformationalVersion`, `PackageVersion`, `PackageReleaseNotes`, and [more](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/3449#issuecomment-916539767)...
- .NET SDK Roll Forward Policy can now be defined via `DotNetCoreSettings.RollForward`
- Cake NuGet packages now include a README with general information and useful links. See [`Cake.Tool`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/) as an example
- Updated Spectre.Console to v0.42.0 (latest as of this writing)

... and more! The full list of changes is [listed below](#issues).
