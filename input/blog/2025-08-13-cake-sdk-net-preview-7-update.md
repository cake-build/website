### SDK Versioning in File-based Apps

One notable improvement addresses the issue mentioned in our [previous announcement](/blog/2025/07/dotnet-cake-cs). The .NET 10 Preview 7 SDK now properly supports SDK versioning in file-based applications, allowing you to specify the Cake.Sdk version directly in your `.cs` files:

```csharp
#:sdk Cake.Sdk@5.0.25225.53-beta

Information("Hello");
```

### Getting Started

To try out the latest preview, update your `global.json` file:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "10.0.100-preview.7.25358.103"
  },
  "msbuild-sdks": {
    "Cake.Sdk": "5.0.25225.53-beta"
  }
}
```

Or install the latest [template package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Template#readme-body-tab):

```bash
dotnet new install Cake.Template@5.0.25225.53-beta
```

Create a `global.json` file to pin versions:

```bash
dotnet new cakeglobaljson
```

Then create a new Cake file-based project:

```bash
dotnet new cakefile --name cake
```

And run it with:

```bash
dotnet cake.cs
```
PLEASE NOTE: this sample cake.cs file assumes that you have a file called 'example.sln' located in a folder called `src`. If you don't have such a solution file, you can create it like so:

```bash
dotnet new cakefile --name cake --IncludeExampleProject true --force
