* Implicit bootstrapping
* Rewritten CLI
* Frosting incorporated into main repository
* Frosting CLI brought up to speed with Cake script runners
* Improved globbing support
* Greatly improved documentation
* Bugfixes, increased test coverage, and integration tests

### Upgrading

See [Upgrade instructions](/docs/getting-started/upgrade#cake-0.38.x-to-cake-1.0) for documentation about breaking changes in this release.

<!--excerpt-->

### .NET 5 Support

Cake 1.0 fully supports running natively under .NET 5 both with scripts using the .NET Tool [Cake.Tool](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-core-tool) and as regular .NET Console applications using the [Cake Frosting](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting) library.

### C# 9 support

With .NET 5 and the latest version of Roslyn comes the full power of C# 9 to your build process.
And if we may say so, records are brilliant for your build state.

```csharp
public record StorageAccount(string Name, string Container, string Key);

public record BuildData(string Version, DotNetCoreMSBuildSettings MSBuildSettings, StorageAccount StorageAccount)
{
    public bool ShouldPublish { get; } = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(StorageAccount.Name)
                                            && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(StorageAccount.Container)
                                            && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(StorageAccount.Key);
}

Setup<BuildData>(context=>{
    var version = context.Argument("version", "1.0.0");

    return new (
        version,
        new DotNetCoreMSBuildSettings()
                                .WithProperty("Version", version)
                                .WithProperty("Configuration", context.Argument("configuration", "Release")),
        new (
            context.EnvironmentVariable("PUBLISH_STORAGE_ACCOUNT"),
            context.EnvironmentVariable("PUBLISH_STORAGE_CONTAINER"),
            context.EnvironmentVariable("PUBLISH_STORAGE_KEY")
        )
    );
});

Task("Build")
    .Does<BuildData>((context, data) => context.Information("Building {0}", data.Version));

RunTarget("Build");
```

### Implicit bootstrapping

Boostrapping of Cake modules is now implicit, which means that you no longer need to execute Cake twice to additionally download and initialize modules, just add the module directive to your script and this will be handled transparently for you.

```c#
#module nuget:?package=Cake.DotNetTool.Module&version=0.4.0
```

### Addin recommended Cake version set to 1.0

We've now set the recommended version of [Cake.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core/1.0.0) for addins to target to 1.0.

This won't break the build but you might see warnings like below when Addins/Modules are loaded.

```bash
The assembly 'Cake.DotNetTool.Module, Version=0.4.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'
is referencing an older version of Cake.Core (0.33.0).
```

### Rewritten CLI

We're now utilizing [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectresystems/spectre.console) for a more robust, flexible and future proof handling of command-line input.

Full details of everything that was included in this release can be seen below.

### Frosting incorporated into main repository

Cake Frosting is now incorporated in the same GitHub repository as ( [cake-build/cake](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/) ) all the other Cake runners, this means it'll be released and supported with the same cadence as them.

### Breaking changes in Cake Frosting

In this release the `UseTool` extension has been renamed to `InstallTool`.
In our prior release candidate we also [noted](/blog/2020/12/cake-v1.0.0-rc0002-released#breaking-changes-in-cake-frosting) that `CakeHostBuilder` has been removed and `CakeHost` can be used directly.

With Cake.Frosting 0.38.x:

```csharp
// Create the host.
var host =
    new CakeHostBuilder()
        .WithArguments(args)
        .UseStartup<Program>()
        .UseTool(new Uri("nuget:?package=ReportGenerator&version=4.8.1"))
        .Build();

// Run the host.
return host.Run();
```

With Cake.Frosting 1.0:

```csharp
// Create and run the host.
return
    new CakeHost()
        .UseContext<BuildContext>()
        .InstallTool(new Uri("nuget:?package=ReportGenerator&version=4.8.1"))
        .Run(args);
```

### Supported operating systems
