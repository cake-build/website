Version **4.0.0** of Cake has been released. Take it for a spin and give us feedback on our [discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/cake-build/discussions/4270).

This release includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes to both [Cake Scripting](/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-tool) and [Cake Frosting](/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting) since the [Cake v3.2.0 release](/blog/2023/11/cake-v3.2.0-released)! 🚀 🍰

### Highlights of this release

- .NET 8 support & C# 12 support
- Improved file APIs
- Addin recommended Cake version set to 4.0.0


### .NET 8 Support & C# 12 Support

Cake now fully supports running on .NET 8, and with this C# 12, which means you can take advantage of the latest framework, runtime, and language improvements.

The supported platform matrix for Cake 4.0.0 will look like this:

| Runner                           | .NET 8                                                | .NET 7                                                | .NET 6                                                |

### Breaking changes

[IFile](/api/Cake.Core.IO/IFile/) has added methods for setting timestamps (see [#4132](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/4132)), while the interface has default implementations it can still break ABI which is why we've marked this change as breaking.

### Addin recommended Cake version set to 4.0.0

We've now set the recommended version of [Cake.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core) for addins to target to 4.0.0.

This won't break the build, but you might see warnings like the one below when addins or modules are loaded.

```bash
The assembly 'Cake.Twitter, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'
is referencing an older version of Cake.Core (3.0.0).
For best compatibility it should target Cake.Core version 4.0.0.
```

The recommended target framework monikers for addins are now

- `net8.0`
- `net7.0`
- `net6.0`
