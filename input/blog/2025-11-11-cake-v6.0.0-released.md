### .NET 10 support & C# 14 support

Cake now fully supports running on .NET 10, and with this C# 14, which means you can take advantage of the latest framework, runtime, and language improvements.

The supported platform matrix for Cake 6.0.0 will look like this:

| Runner                           | .NET 10                                                | .NET 9                                                | .NET 8                                                |

### New runner: Cake.Sdk

We're excited to announce **Cake.Sdk** as a new official runner for Cake! Cake.Sdk provides a modern way to get the Cake tool scripting experience in regular .NET console applications. This brings you the stellar experience of the new ["dotnet run app.cs"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-run-app/) feature (requires .NET 10), while also working seamlessly with .NET 8 and 9 for regular csproj projects.

Here's the minimal example:

```csharp
#:sdk Cake.Sdk

Information("Hello world!");
```

```bash
dotnet cake.cs
```

Cake.Sdk is a custom SDK that provides a convenient way to create Cake projects with minimal configuration. It automatically sets up common properties and provides a streamlined development experience for Cake-based build automation projects, whether you're using the new file-based approach or traditional project-based builds.

Key features include:

- **Minimal Project Configuration**: Create Cake projects with just a few lines in your `.csproj` file
- **File-based Build Scripts**: Use the new `#:sdk Cake.Sdk` directive for standalone `.cs` files
- **Optimized Build Settings**: Pre-configured with optimal settings for Cake projects
- **Built-in Source Generation**: Includes Cake.Generator by default for automatic source generation capabilities
- **Full Cake Addin & Module Support**: All existing Cake addins and modules work seamlessly
- **Native .NET CLI Publish Support**: Create self-contained precompiled binaries and containers

### Cake.Template

The easiest way to get started with Cake.Sdk is using the **Cake.Template** package, which provides several templates for different scenarios:

First, install the template package:

```bash
dotnet new install Cake.Template
```

Create a new Cake file-based project:

```bash
dotnet new cakefile --name cake
```

For the simplest possible setup, you can use the minimal template:

```bash
dotnet new cakeminimal --name cake
```

For larger projects, you can organize your code across multiple files:

```bash
dotnet new cakemultifile --name cake
```

For traditional project-based approach:

```bash
dotnet new cakeproj --Framework net10.0 --name cake
```

### Addin recommended Cake version set to 6.0.0

We've now set the recommended version of [Cake.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core) for addins to target to 6.0.0.

This won't break the build, but you might see warnings like the one below when addins or modules are loaded.

```bash
The assembly 'Cake.Addin, Version=5.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'
is referencing an older version of Cake.Core (5.0.0).
For best compatibility it should target Cake.Core version 6.0.0.
```

The recommended target framework monikers for addins are now:

- `net10.0`
- `net9.0`
- `net8.0`
