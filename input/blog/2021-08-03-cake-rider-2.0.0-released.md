### Release Notes

Full details of everything that was included in this release can be seen
in the [release notes](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-rider/releases/tag/2.0.0) for this version.

#### Details on the removed setting for custom extensions

Previously Cake for Rider had a setting to change the file extension
for cake files away from the default of `cake`.

![old version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349188/125769368-f69d9e10-d5e6-4c0c-a857-dc98463d2f82.png){.img-responsive}

This setting sadly was not usable in all features of Cake for Rider and also lead to
[a bug](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-rider/issues/160) under some circumstances.

Hence, this setting was removed. Instead it is suggested to use the default
function of Rider to associate file patterns to file types. This setting can be found under *File* | *Settings* | *Editor* | *File Types* 

![Rider default settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349188/125768879-3780fbf4-7e68-41db-a6ed-6d7f90f14f5d.png){.img-responsive}

Under *Recognized File Types* select *Cake Scripts* and then under *File name pattern* 
set the desired pattern.

There is no automatic migration from the old Cake for Rider specific setting of the Cake extension to the default Rider settings.
If you had a custom extension set, you are required to set this manually in the *File Types*, as explained above.
