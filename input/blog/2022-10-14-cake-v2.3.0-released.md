Version **2.3.0** of Cake has been released. Take it for a spin and give us feedback on our [discussion board](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions/3982).

This release includes new features, improvements and bug fixes to both [Cake Scripting](/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-tool) and [Cake Frosting](/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting) since the [Cake v2.2.0 release](/blog/2022/04/cake-v2.2.0-released)! 🚀 🍰

### Highlights of this release

- Better global script cache support
- .NET CLI workload aliases
- Command aliases

### Better global script cache support

Script cache introduced in [v2.2.0](/blog/2022/04/cake-v2.2.0-released) has been improved to support parallel builds and multiple versions of the same script even when the cache is in a globally shared location.

### Command aliases

While Cake support many tools out of the box or via the many available addins, there will always be tools or scenarios where you need to execute a custom tool, while this is already possible using the [StartProcess](https://cakebuild.net/api/Cake.Common/ProcessAliases/C40DC6C0) alias, you need to write custom code for things like i.e. tool resolution, exit code handling, and handling command output.

To solve this we've in this release introduced the Command alias which fills the gap in-between StartProcess and the out-of-the-box typed aliases, it lets you benefit from Cake's built-in tool resolution making it easier to support tools with different executables i.e. Posix/Windows or installed using tool directive. It will default fail the build on non-zero exit codes, and also provides more convenient access to standard output/error. 
A few Command alias examples below, and several more in the features [pull request](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/pull/3948).

#### Executing tool using implicit ProcessArgumentBuilder

```csharp
Command(
    new []{ "dotnet", "dotnet.exe"},
    "--version"
);
```

#### Executing tool using ProcessArgumentBuilder

```csharp
#tool dotnet:?package=DPI&version=2022.8.21.54
Command(
    new []{ "dpi", "dpi.exe"},
    new ProcessArgumentBuilder()
        .Append("nuget")
        .AppendQuoted(Context.Environment.WorkingDirectory.FullPath)
        .AppendSwitch("--output", " ", "TABLE")
        .Append("analyze")
);
```

#### Executing tool specifying expected exit code

```csharp
Command(
    new []{ "dotnet", "dotnet.exe"},
    expectedExitCode: -2147450751
);
```

#### Executing tool using settings customization

```csharp
Command(
    new []{ "dotnet", "dotnet.exe"},
    settingsCustomization: settings => settings
                                            .WithToolName(".NET tool")
                                            .WithExpectedExitCode(1)
                                            .WithArgumentCustomization(args => args.Append("tool"))
);
```

#### Reusable tools settings i.e. created in setup.

```csharp
#tool dotnet:?package=DPI&version=2022.8.21.54
// Reusable tools settings i.e. created in setup.
var settings = new CommandSettings {
        ToolName = "DPI",
        ToolExecutableNames =  new []{ "dpi", "dpi.exe"},
     };

// Example with ProcessArgumentBuilder
Command(
    settings,
    new ProcessArgumentBuilder()
         .Append("nuget")
         .AppendQuoted(Context.Environment.WorkingDirectory.FullPath)
         .AppendSwitch("--output", " ", "TABLE")
         .Append("analyze")
);

// Example with implicit ProcessArgumentBuilder
Command(
     settings,
     $"nuget --output TABLE analyze"
);
```


#### Handling standard output

```csharp
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
using System.Text.Json;
#tool dotnet:?package=DPI&version=2022.8.21.54

// Example with ProcessArgumentBuilder
var exitCode = Command(
    new []{ "dpi", "dpi.exe"},
    out var standardOutput,
    new ProcessArgumentBuilder()
         .Append("nuget")
         .AppendQuoted(Context.Environment.WorkingDirectory.FullPath)
         .AppendSwitch("--output", " ", "JSON")
         .Append("analyze")
);

var packageReferences =  JsonSerializer.Deserialize<DPIPackageReference[]>(
    standardOutput
);

// Record used in example above
public record DPIPackageReference(
    [property: JsonPropertyName("source")]
    string Source,
    [property: JsonPropertyName("sourceType")]
    string SourceType,
    [property: JsonPropertyName("packageId")]
    string PackageId,
    [property: JsonPropertyName("version")]
    string Version
);
```

#### Handling standard error

```csharp
// Example with ProcessArgumentBuilder
var exitCode = Command(
    new []{ "dotnet", "dotnet.exe" },
    out var standardOutput,
    out var standardError,
    new ProcessArgumentBuilder()
        .Append("tool"),
    expectedExitCode:1
);

Verbose("Exit code: {0}", exitCode);
Information("Output: {0}", standardOutput);
Error("Error: {0}", standardError);
```
