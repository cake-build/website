Version 0.38.5 of Cake has been released.

In this version, we've just addressed an issue where the upcoming .NET 5 wasn't identified as .NET Core application but .NET 4 / Mono.

This could cause issues with `Cake.Tool` for example when running .NET Framework executable on non-Windows platforms or scripts reused cross-runtime.

Even though .NET 5 isn't released, we choose to release this as a hotfix so early adopters wouldn't hit this roadblock, but also for our own dogfooding - as we're building Cake with Cake and have started the process of porting Cake to .NET 5.
