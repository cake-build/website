Version 0.27.1 of Cake has been released.

This is a hotfix release of Cake.  Following the release of Cake 0.27.0 it was noted that there was an issue with loading some dependencies, which would result in a Stack Overflow exception.  This was first noted [here](https://gitter.im/cake-build/cake?at=5ada054962316e0505e0371c), and also [here](https://github.com/SharpeRAD/Cake.Powershell/issues/55).

As a result of these issues being raised, a bug was identified in the ScriptAssemblyResolver.cs where it could end up in an endless loop.  This bug has now been addressed.
