Version **2.0.0 RC 1** of Cake has been released. Take it for a spin and give us feedback on our [discussion board](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions/3680).

This is the first pre-release of Cake 2.0🎉
In this blog post, we will go through some of the major new features of 2.0, which platforms are supported, and how **you** can help to get Cake 2.0 released.

### Highlights of this release

- Improved aliases for `dotnet`
- Improved GitHub Actions integration
- Improved Azure Pipelines integration
- Removed support for [Cake runner for .NET Framework] and [Cake runner for .NET Core]
- Updated .NET target frameworks

... and more! The full list of changes is [listed below](#issues).

### Upgrading

See [Upgrade instructions](/docs/getting-started/upgrade#cake-1.x-to-cake-2.0) for documentation about breaking changes in this release.

<!--excerpt-->

### Supported runners and required .NET version

To allow Cake to make use of modern platform features, make life easier for extension authors and simplify decision process of users
we have decided to stop shipping [Cake runner for .NET Framework] and the already deprecated [Cake runner for .NET Core] with 2.0.
Additionally we dropped support to run on .NET Core 2.1 and .NET Core 3.0 for [Cake .NET Tool] and [Cake Frosting].

This means that, starting with Cake 2.0, you will need to have the .NET SDK installed on your build machine, at a minimum .NET Core 3.1,
but .NET 6 is recommended, in order to **run** Cake.
In other words, Cake itself will no longer **run** on .NET Framework, Mono and .NET Core 3.0 or older.
Cake will continue to support building of .NET Framework projects as well as projects targeting .NET Core 3.0 or older.

Supported platform matrix for Cake 2.0 will look like this:

| Runner                           | .NET 6 | .NET 5 | .NET Core 3.1 |
| -------------------------------- |:------:|:------:|:-------------:|
| [Cake .NET Tool]                 | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> |
| [Cake Frosting]                  | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> |

As a consequence of no longer shipping [Cake runner for .NET Framework] we will also stop shipping the [Cake.Portable Chocolatey package]
and [Homebrew Cake formulae].

[Cake runner for .NET Core] has been deprecated since version 1.0 with [Cake .NET Tool] as the suggested replacement.
For users of [Cake runner for .NET Framework] it is also suggested to switch to [Cake .NET Tool] and run builds on .NET Core 3.1 or newer.
For users which rely on an extension, or other dependencies, which require .NET Framework or .NET Core 3.0 or older, suggestion is to stay on Cake 1.x.

See [Sunsetting of .NET Framework and .NET Core runners in Cake 2.0] for details.

### Improvements to aliases for dotnet

Cake 1.x had many [`DotNetCore***`](https://cakebuild.net/dsl/dotnetcore/) aliases for executing `dotnet` such as `DotNetCoreBuild`, `DotNetCoreTest`, etc.
The `Core` part in the name existed for historical reasons when .NET Core was first introduced and lasted until v3.1.
[With .NET 5, Microsoft dropped the "Core" from the name](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/), and Cake 2.0 follows this naming schema for its .NET aliases:
`DotNetCoreBuild` becomes `DotNetBuild`, `DotNetCoreTest` becomes `DotNetTest`, etc.

:::{.alert .alert-info}
Note that the old aliases are still available but deprecated and will be removed in Cake 3.0.

See [#3341](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/3341) for details.

### Improved GitHub Actions integration

Cake 2.0 comes with a few improvements to the GitHub Actions build provider:

- Properties of files and paths are now of type `FilePath` and `DirectoryPath`
- New `Environment` properties which returns runtime info, runner name and workflow action path
- `UploadArtifact` command to upload a local directory or file into a file container folder and create an artifact.
- `SetEnvironmentVariable ` command to create or update an environment variable for any steps running next in a job.
- `AddPath` command to add a directory to the system PATH variable and automatically make it available to all subsequent actions in the current job.

### Improved Azure Pipelines integration

Cake 2.0 comes with a few improvements to the Azure Pipelines build provider.
See [Azure Pipelines build provider updates](/docs/getting-started/upgrade#azure-pipelines-build-provider-updates) for details.

### Addin recommended Cake version set to 2.0

We've now set the recommended version of [Cake.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core) for addins to target to 2.0.

This won't break the build but you might see warnings like below when addins or modules are loaded.

```bash
The assembly 'Cake.FileHelpers, Version=4.0.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'
is referencing an older version of Cake.Core (1.0.0).
```

### How can you help?

Help us by taking Cake 2.0 RC 1 for spin, test your scripts, addins and modules, if you have have questions please raise them on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions) and report any issues on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues).

Easiest and safest way to test is by using [.NET Tool](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-core-tool) with a local tool manifest.

```bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install Cake.Tool --version 2.0.0-rc0001
```

Then Cake will be available only in that folder where you created the manifest and not interfere with any other of your Cake projects.

```bash
dotnet cake build.cake
```
