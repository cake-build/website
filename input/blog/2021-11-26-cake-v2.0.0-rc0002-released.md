### Supported runners and required .NET version

To allow Cake to make use of modern platform features, make life easier for extension authors and simplify decision process of users
we have decided to stop shipping [Cake runner for .NET Framework] and the already deprecated [Cake runner for .NET Core] with 2.0.
Additionally we dropped support to run on .NET Core 2.1 and .NET Core 3.0 for [Cake .NET Tool] and [Cake Frosting].

This means that, starting with Cake 2.0, you will need to have the .NET SDK installed on your build machine, at a minimum .NET Core 3.1,
but .NET 6 is recommended, in order to **run** Cake.
In other words, Cake itself will no longer **run** on .NET Framework, Mono and .NET Core 3.0 or older.
Cake will continue to support building of .NET Framework projects as well as projects targeting .NET Core 3.0 or older.

Supported platform matrix for Cake 2.0 will look like this:

| Runner                           | .NET 6 | .NET 5 | .NET Core 3.1 |
| -------------------------------- |:------:|:------:|:-------------:|
| [Cake .NET Tool]                 | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> |
| [Cake Frosting]                  | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green"></i> |

As a consequence of no longer shipping [Cake runner for .NET Framework] we will also stop shipping the [Cake.Portable Chocolatey package]
and [Homebrew Cake formulae].

[Cake runner for .NET Core] has been deprecated since version 1.0 with [Cake .NET Tool] as the suggested replacement.
For users of [Cake runner for .NET Framework] it is also suggested to switch to [Cake .NET Tool] and run builds on .NET Core 3.1 or newer.
For users which rely on an extension, or other dependencies, which require .NET Framework or .NET Core 3.0 or older, suggestion is to stay on Cake 1.x.

See [Sunsetting of .NET Framework and .NET Core runners in Cake 2.0] for details.

### How can you help?

Help us by taking Cake 2.0 RC 2 for spin, test your scripts, addins and modules, if you have have questions please raise them on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions) and report any issues on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues).

Easiest and safest way to test is by using [.NET Tool](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-core-tool) with a local tool manifest.

```bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install Cake.Tool --version 2.0.0-rc0002
```

Then Cake will be available only in that folder where you created the manifest and not interfere with any other of your Cake projects.

```bash
dotnet cake build.cake
```
