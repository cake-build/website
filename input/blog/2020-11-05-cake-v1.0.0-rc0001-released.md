Version 1.0.0-rc0001 of Cake has been released

This version is the 110th release of Cake, but the first pre-release of Cake 1.0🎉
In this blog post, we will go through some of the major new features of 1.0, which platforms are supported, and how **you** can help to get Cake 1.0 released.

### Why Release Candidate?

We've chosen to release 1.0 as a pre-release to NuGet and Chocolatey, so we and the community can more easily test and ensure that our 1.0 release will be as stable as possible.
It will also enable us to see if there are any steps you need to take to adapt your scripts for 1.0, and for us to see if there're any unintended breaking changes, by testing as many addins, modules, and recipes as possible.

### Major new features

* .NET 5 support
* C# 9 support
* Implicit bootstrapping
* Rewritten CLI
* Frosting incorporated into main repository
* Improved globbing support
* Improved documentation
* Bugfixes, increased test coverage, and integration tests

### Upgrading

See [Upgrade instructions](/docs/getting-started/upgrade#cake-0.38.x-to-cake-1.0) for documentation about breaking changes in this release.

<!--excerpt-->

### .NET 5 Support

Cake 1.0 will fully support running natively under .NET 5 both with scripts using the .NET Tool [Cake.Tool](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-core-tool) and as regular .NET Console applications using the [Cake.Frosting](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting) library.

### C# 9 support

With .NET 5 and the latest version of Roslyn comes the full power of C# 9 to your build process.
And if we may say so, records are brilliant for your build state.

```csharp
public record StorageAccount(
    string Name,
    string Container,
    string Key
);

public record BuildData(
    string Version,
    DotNetCoreMSBuildSettings MSBuildSettings,
    StorageAccount StorageAccount
)
{
    public bool ShouldPublish { get; } = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(StorageAccount.Name)
                                            && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(StorageAccount.Container)
                                            && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(StorageAccount.Key);
}

Setup<BuildData>(context=>{
    var version = context.Argument("version", "1.0.0");

    return new (
        version,
        new DotNetCoreMSBuildSettings()
                                .WithProperty("Version", version)
                                .WithProperty("Configuration", context.Argument("configuration", "Release")),
        new (
            context.EnvironmentVariable("PUBLISH_STORAGE_ACCOUNT"),
            context.EnvironmentVariable("PUBLISH_STORAGE_CONTAINER"),
            context.EnvironmentVariable("PUBLISH_STORAGE_KEY")
        )
    );
});

Task("Build")
    .Does<BuildData>((context, data) => context.Information("Building {0}", data.Version));

RunTarget("Build");
```

### Implicit bootstrapping

Boostrapping of Cake modules is now implicit, which means that you no longer will need to execute Cake twice to additionally download and initialize modules, just add the module directive to your script and this will be handled transparently for you.

```c#
#module nuget:?package=Cake.DotNetTool.Module&version=0.4.0
```

### Rewritten CLI

We're now utilizing [Spectre.Cli](https://spectresystems.github.io/spectre.cli/) for a more robust, flexible and future proof handling of command line input.

Full details of everything that was included in this release can be seen below.

### Frosting incorporated into main repository

Cake Frosting is now incorporated in the same GitHub repository as ( [cake-build/cake](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/) ) all the other Cake runners, this means it'll be released and supported with the same cadence as them.

### How can you help?

Help us by taking Cake 1.0.0 RC 1 for spin, test your scripts, addins and modules, if you have have questions please raise them on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions) and report any issues on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues).

Easiest and safest way to test is by using [.NET Tool](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-core-tool) with a local tool manifest.

```bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install Cake.Tool --version 1.0.0-rc0001
```

Then Cake will be available only in that folder where you created the manifest and not interfere with any other of your Cake projects.

```bash
dotnet cake build.cake
```
