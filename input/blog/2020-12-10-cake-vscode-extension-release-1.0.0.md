The Cake Team is very happy to announce the 1.0.0 release of the [Cake Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cake-build.cake-vscode).  This release has been a long time in the making, but we are hoping that it will be worth the wait!

With the upcoming release of Cake 1.0.0, and the transition in our documentation to recommend the usage of the [Cake .NET Tool](/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-tool), the main focus of this version of the extension was to start using the Cake .NET Tool for all of the built in actions.  For example:

* If you choose `Run Task` from the command palette, the chosen task will be executed using the Cake .Net Tool
* If you use the code lens options to either `run task` or `debug task`, the Cake .Net Tool will be used

:::{.alert .alert-info}
If the Cake .Net Tool isn't installed, it will be installed for you.
:::

In all of these cases, you can override the default options to revert to using either the [Cake runner for .NET Framework](/docs/running-builds/runners/deprecated/cake-runner-for-dotnet-framework) or the [Cake runner for .NET Core](/docs/running-builds/runners/deprecated/cake-runner-for-dotnet-core).

### Thanks

I personally wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who joined in on my weekly [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/gep13) stream, where I have been working on this extension for the last 6 weeks.  Without all of your input and guidance, this release wouldn't have happened.  Also, a huge thank you to [Nils Andresen](https://github.com/nils-a) who has made a number of contributions to the extension.  Thank you all!
