title: Cake v1.1.0 released
category: Release Notes

releaseName: 1.1.0
---

Version 1.1.0 of Cake has been released. Take it for a spin and give us feedback on our [discussion board](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions).

This is the first release since our big [Cake 1.0 milestone release](/blog/2021/02/cake-v1.0.0-released), and includes new features, improvements and bug fixes to both [Cake Scripting](/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-tool) and [Cake Frosting](/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting).

### Highlights of this release

- .NET tools are now natively supported in Cake builds via `#tool dotnet:`
  - The [Cake.DotNetTool.Module](/extensions/cake-dotnettool-module/ ) is bundled with Cake from now on and is no longer required as a separate package/dependency.
    Starting with this release, `Cake.DotNetTool.Module` will always be released together with Cake and will only be compatible with the current release.
    If you use `Cake.DotNetTool.Module` already on your builds do *one* of the following:
      - Upgrade Cake to version 1.1.0, and _remove_ the `Cake.DotNetTool.Module` from your build script (as it's no longer needed).
      - Or pin `Cake.DotNetTool.Module` to a version compatible with the Cake version that you use. `Cake.DotNetTool.Module` version 1.0.1 is the last version compatible with Cake 1.0.0.
- Cake Frosting: Tools are now installed in the working directory by default, and Frosting now honors the `Tools` path defined in `cake.config` the same way that Cake scripting does
- TeamCity: Additional properties of TeamCity builds is now available to Cake builds
- Azure Pipelines: Output variables in Azure Pipelines can be used to share build data between different stages and/or different tasks
- Improved tool resolution to prefer tools compatible with the platform where the build is running on
- Several improvements on coloring of console output when running Cake builds:
  - Colored build output is now enabled by default when running Cake on Azure Pipelines and TeamCity
  - We removed the default black background on build log messages and we now use the default background color of the console, which makes build logs look great if you use a custom background color, such as PowerShell
  - It's now possible to turn off coloring of console output by defining an environment variable called [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org)

... and more! The full list of changes is [listed below](#issues).

### Upgrading

If you are upgrading from Cake 1.0 and using the [.NET tool as we recommend](/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-tool), all you need to do is to update the Cake .NET tool:

```powershell
# If you are using the .NET tool as a local tool for the repository
dotnet tool install --local Cake.Tool

# If you are using the .NET tool as a global tool for the user
dotnet tool install --global Cake.Tool
```

See [Upgrade instructions](/docs/getting-started/upgrade) for detailed instructions how to upgrade to a newer Cake version and upgrade instructions for previous releases.
